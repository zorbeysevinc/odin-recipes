        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The basis of all Roman pasta dishes, cacio e pepe, is a simple primo piatto consisting 
            of only three main ingredients: pasta, Pecorino Romano, and pepper, with pasta cooking 
            water being the crucial fourth ingredient that's essential to make the sauce. However, 
            although at first glance, a simple dish to make, the technique may take some practice 
            to perfect, since the sauce has to be just right — that is, creamy, silky, and luscious. 
            The secret lies in concentrating starch by cooking pasta in a small amount of water, 
            which is then used to dilute the Pecorino Romano before it's stirred, off heat, together 
            with pasta, ground pepper, and the rest of the water. As a finishing touch, once plated, 
            and before serving, all that is required is a light sprinkling of pepper and, optionally, 
            grated pecorino.

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400g spaghetti</li>
            <li>180g Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>8 pinches of roasted and crushed pepper</li>
            <li>Salt, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the peppercorns in a nonstick pan over medium heat, until they start turning 
                translucent.</li>
            <li>Then, place the peppercorns on a paper towel to cool. Once cooled, crush them in 
                a mortar and pestle or with the back of a pan, so you end up with pepper that is 
                fine as a powder but interspersed with larger specks of pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, then salt it and throw in the spaghetti to cook 
                until al dente — ideally, boil the spaghetti in a smaller amount of water so you 
                end up with cooking water that has more starch which will help make a creamier 
                sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the Pecorino Romano to an aluminum pan, then add four ladlefuls of the hot 
                cooking water, mixing it as you add.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese has melted, add the pepper, and add the pasta (take it out of 
                the water using a carving fork or thongs, so there is still water left on the 
                spaghetti) and mix until the sauce coats the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, on a hot plate, sprinkled with pepper and Pecorino Romano.</li>
        </ol>
