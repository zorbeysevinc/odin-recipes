        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This no-bake dessert is made simply by layering Savoiardi or Pavesini ladyfingers soaked in sugar 
            and coffee syrup with rich, velvety mascarpone cheese. For the most authentic flavor, use only 
            the strongest, traditional Italian robusto espresso. The name of this famous Italian dessert 
            stems from “tira mi sù”, an expression in the Vèneto dialect that literally translates as “pick 
            me up” — most likely a reference to the uplifting effects of tiramisù’s combination of sugar, 
            cocoa, and coffee.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 egg yolks</li>
            <li>500g (1.1 lbs) sugar</li>
            <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) mascarpone</li>
            <li>60 pcs Savoiardi ladyfingers</li>
            <li>Strong coffee, as needed</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the coffee and let it cool</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with sugar until light and fluffy, and then gently 
                incorporate mascarpone cheese into the mixture until you obtain a smooth paste</li>
            <li>Once the coffee has cooled down, start dipping in the ladyfingers one by one, 
                being careful not to over-soak them</li>
            <li>Arrange ladyfingers in a single row at the center of a round serving plate, and 
                spread half of the cream over them. Repeat the second step with the remaining 30 
                coffee-dipped biscuits, and arrange them on top of the first layer</li>
            <li>Spread with the remaining mascarpone cream, generously dust with sifted cocoa 
                powder, and refrigerate for several hours until serving time</li>
        </ol>
